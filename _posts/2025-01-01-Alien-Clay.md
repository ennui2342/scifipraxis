The star of Alien Clay is the ecology of the world of Kiln - shades of new weird and body horror reminiscent of Vandermeer, but with a sound biological rationale that frames a radically different ecology rather than just an alien or two. Kiln is decidedly not an earthlike world.  
  
The novel weaves two narrative strands - the mystery of the world of Kiln with its tantalisingly ambiguous artefacts of a past civilisation, alongside the lived experience of a repressive and dystopic frontier work camp under the totalitarian rule of the Mandate. Through the first-person story of one of the newly incarcerated, the hostility of Kiln's ecosystem is revealed as they labour to maintain the human foothold and uncover who built the artefacts and what happened to them.  
  
The systemic oppression of the individuals in the work camp also plays a symbolic counterpoint to the intensely collaborative and decentralised symbiotic ecology of Kiln. Tchaikovsky imagines a fecund world of ecological lego eager to biologically subsume the small human outpost into its collective, mirroring the Mandate's political subjugation of the individual within its rigid doctrine.  
  
It takes a while to lay this out; the first 100 pages or so are low on plot and high on exposition, as the political scene is set and the world-building is established. But once the foundations are in place, the pacing is brisk and accelerates as the shit hits the fan. The mystery builds and the story twists in unexpected ways, opening up new questions with each reveal.  
  
Alien Clay is hard science fiction that deftly explores the implications of a truly alien ecology where evolution took a different path. If ecology is the common ground where individuals and society converge, how will we find a new balance in this alien landscape?
