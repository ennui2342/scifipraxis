Thought-provoking SF - each story asks 'What if?' and constructs a detailed world of consequences. While Chiang's imagination is incredibly vivid, the short story format sometimes leads to narratives heavy on exposition, but, as a collection, it's remarkably strong with a couple of standout pieces that make it well worth the read.

Tower of Babylon (1990) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A mining team is hired to climb the tower of Babylon and break through the vault of heaven. What will they find on the other side?

Understand (1991) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A medical procedure unlocks accelerating post-human abilities. With enlightenment within his reach, what could stop him?

Division by Zero (1991) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A mathematician has a crisis of faith when her reality is tested by a mathematical proof.

Story of Your Life (1998) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The story that the film Arrival was based on. An alien contact story, given heft by a poignant parallel tale of loss.

Seventy-two Letters (2000) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A lexical basis for genetics is proposed. Feels like it's trying too hard at the worldbuilding and outstays its welcome.

The Evolution of Human Science (2000) ‚≠ê

A plot-free slice of life in a few pages. Not my thing.

Hell is the Absence of God (2001) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

God, Heaven, and Hell are all very tangible to humans. A man's attempt to join his wife in Heaven runs up against an uncaring God.¬†A bit heavy on the religious theme and message for my taste.

Liking What You See: A Documentary (2002) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A technology has made the perception of beauty optional. The documentary format felt heavy on exposition, but it finished on a high note as the next escalation in this technology was revealed.
