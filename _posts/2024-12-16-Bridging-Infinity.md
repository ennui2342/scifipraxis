On the whole a disappointing collection given the heavyweight lineup. There were a couple of interesting climate fiction stories, but far too many duds for me to recommend it. Ken Liu's story Seven Birthdays was by far the standout read - a tale of post-humanity through deep time threaded by melancholic reflections on family. Catch it instead in his collection The Hidden Girl and Other Stories.
