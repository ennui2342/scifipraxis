Neil Hanson is summoned back to a thriving colony he and an old friend founded 200 years ago in their relativistically dilated youth. Intelligence has unexpectedly emerged in the native life, threatening dire consequences for the settlers' descendants once Earth's government intervenes.

Hutchinson's dialogue-heavy novella paints a vivid history of a colony privately established by itinerant rich kids and their cargo of sleeping pioneers centuries earlier. As Neil tries to find a solution to their alien problem, we learn the backstory of the now legendary founding four and uncover long-buried secrets. 

Neil’s character emerges quickly through sharp, witty exchanges that feel entirely authentic. The worldbuilding and history provide a solid backdrop to the plot, and the resolution lands perfectly. This is as good as novellas get — and the perfect entry point for discovering Hutchinson.
