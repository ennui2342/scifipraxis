A tale of a dystopian future where lives are hollowed out to the point of despair and culture is no more. People have turned away from books and spend lives addicted to vacuous hyperactive media, reduced to bland pap by the desire to offend noone.  
  
Bradburys short book hits home because of its prescience in understanding the impact of modern media, still a recognisable danger today in the rise of Tiktok, the decline in reading, and the revisionist approach to literature.  
  
Whilst not up to modern genre standards of plot and characterisation, Fahrenheit 451 remains a must-read for its description of a believable path to a future which is still as threatening today as it was 70 years ago. As we move into the AI age where reading and writing will be increasingly outsourced to tools, we need to keep Bradbury's cautionary tale in mind and ask ourselves what kind of society we might be sleepwalking into.
