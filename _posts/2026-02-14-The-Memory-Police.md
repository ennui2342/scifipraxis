On an isolated island, things occasionally disappear – one day it's hats, another roses. As the disappearances accumulate, residents lose more of their memories, but the few who don't forget are hunted down by the Memory Police.

The magical realism of the disappearances means it's never clear whether this slow-motion apocalypse is psychological or physical. It's certainly not the Orwellian dystopia that the title might suggest, but a more subtle metaphysical horror. The Memory Police are a symptom rather than a cause, whilst the fatalistic residents are collaborators in their own demise.

The spare and dreamlike prose has that Ballardian feel of desolation and surreal timelessness. Short austere paragraphs are packed with hauntingly evocative details that eschew the widescreen panorama, turning inward to a focus on the minutiae, the peripheral phenomenological details of everyday existence.

The writing is excellent, but the narrative is cyclical, lacking escalation and momentum. To read in a single sitting is to be immersed, but over several sessions, it didn't pull me back. Structurally, a couple of problems stood out. The embedded story felt redundant, foreshadowing but not establishing sufficient contrast with the main narrative to earn its time. Secondly, the companion R is an epistemic anchor for the reader. He acts as a witness to psychological decay over physical change, collapsing the metaphysical uncertainty. But this is undermined by the perpetual winter – what should have been an allegorical blank slate is apparently real, creating a dissonance I found frustrating.

Ogawa posits no explanations, presenting mood as argument. This is allegorical speculative fiction rather than the social SF I was expecting, and I strained to find her meaning. It's a poignant mood masterpiece, politically hollow in its analysis of authoritarian dystopias, but richly overflowing as a zoomed-in dystopian literary character study. For me, it doesn't earn its length - as a phenomenological short story it would have excelled, but as an ideological novel its narrative potential is squandered.
