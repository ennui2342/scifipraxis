The Circulation of the Blood... by Brian W. Aldiss (1966) ‚≠ê  
I don't know if Aldiss was deliberately writing a condescending protagonist in an abusive relationship, but he succeeded. The story was thin, consisting mostly of pontificating and a cringeworthy adultery plot which entirely failed to prop up the philosophical rationale of the story.  
  
...And the Stagnation of the Heart by Brian W. Aldiss (1968) ‚≠ê  
Same characters with added nonsense.  
  
High Treason by Poul Anderson (1966) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
A solider's monologue as he awaits execution over his unwillingness to undertake a war crime, not because of its horror but because of its consequences. Over just fourteen pages Anderson convincingly world builds a galactic conflict and politics, writes some beautiful prose, and hits us with a meaty moral quandary.  
  
The Dipteroid Phenomenon by Poul Anderson (1969) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
While scientists are surveying a fallen planet that was once part of a galactic empire, one of them is murdered by a native. A clash of cultural norms is set against a need for revenge and culminates in a beautifully written d√©nouement.  
  
A Hero's Life by James Blish (1966) ‚≠ê  
I read this one twice and still found it hard to follow. Blish does rewrite this story in a later collection stating that he wrote this version in a rush, so maybe it's not just me.  
  
Skysign by James Blish (1968) ‚≠ê  
Another dislikable main character, but this time intentionally so from Blish. Dated street talk, period derogatory slang, along with misogyny being central to the story make this one unenjoyable. As a character development point it's implied the protagonist mass-raped unconscious women without any consequential follow-up in the plot.  
  
The God's Themselves Throw Incense by Harry Harrison (1966) ‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Three survivors in an escape pod have enough air for two... Whilst this is a story we've seen before, Harrison executes it competently as the thin veneer of civilised behaviour breaks down.¬†  
  
The Ghoul Squad by Harry Harrison (1968) ‚≠ê‚≠ê  
A story about opt-in organ donation. Neatly done, but not really much in the way of SF here.
