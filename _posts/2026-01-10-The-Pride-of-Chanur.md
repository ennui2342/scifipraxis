An unknown alien species seeks refuge on a freighter of the Hani, escaping the abuse of its Kif captors. As fighting flares between the Kif and Hani over ownership of the seemingly sentient outsider, the fragile political Compact is pushed to the brink of collapse, spreading unrest from station to station.

Cherryh's quotidian universe of traders, stations, and planets is the space operatic backdrop for an intense bottle episode of politics and conflict. The single point of view of the Hani captain is in sharp contrast to the action-driven modern multi-pov epics of contemporary SF, allowing for a more intimate character story full of introspection and interior monologues. That isn't to say that Cherryh can't do action — her infrequent conflicts are fast-paced and pack a powerful punch, bracketed as they are by contrasting quiet interludes.

While occasionally the Hani can feel somatically like humans with fur, Cherryh excels at manifesting the alien through their social differences - female-only crews, clan power struggles, loyalty and betrayal. By concentrating on the captain exclusively, we're submerged in the culture of the Hani, though that can leave other perspectives, such as the outsider, frustratingly undeveloped in this short novel. Her realistic portrayal of the language barriers between species, and their subsequent pidgin English dialogue, prevents the reader from a deep connection beyond the Hani, but succeeds in immersing the reader in the captain's personal experience of negotiating perpetual cultural dissonance. 

There's no radical social SF thesis on display here, instead this is a competent space opera adventure story that's heavy on the politics. It's a slice of life, in a broader universe, where a single conflict is worked out across just three stations and a planet. That deep focus, both on character and story, rewards those seeking the worldbuilding and prepared to read on in her universe, but may disappoint those looking for a more epic and action-oriented tale.
